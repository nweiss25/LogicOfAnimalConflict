# LogicOfAnimalConflict
Recreating the results of the game theory/ecology paper The Logic of Animal Conflict by Smith and Price.
This was the final project for my introduction to Applied Math class.

This Project involved carefully parsing the details of the paper to match their approach, object oriented programming and mathematical modeling.

I tweaked this a few months later to make it a little better.
